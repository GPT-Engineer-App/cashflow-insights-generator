Create indirect cash flow statement using below prompt: The indirect cash flow statement provides information about the changes in a company's operating, investing, and financing activities that have not resulted in direct cash receipts or payments. It includes non-cash transactions such as depreciation, amortization, and accruals. The indirect cash flow statement can be generated using the following steps:



Prepare the income statement and balance sheet for the relevant period.

Calculate net income by adjusting for any non-operating items like interest income/expense, extraordinary gains/losses, etc., from the income statement.

Add back any non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization to net income to arrive at adjusted net income (ANI). This is because these expenses do not involve actual cash outflows during the period but are used to reduce taxable earnings in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in India (GAAP).

Calculate changes in working capital by preparing a schedule of current assets (excluding inventories) and current liabilities from the balance sheet for both beginning and end of period along with their corresponding amounts at cost or market value whichever is lower or higher respectively as per GAAP requirements 5 . Subtract opening balances from closing balances to arrive at changes in working capital 6 . Add back ANI figure calculated earlier if there is an increase i n working capital otherwise subtract it if there is a decrease . This will give you adjusted change s i n w o r k i n g cap ital , which represents all those activities that have not resulted directly into c ash flows but still affect business operations .  7 For example : If current assets increased by Rs 100 crore , then add this amount here; similarly if they decreased by Rs 50 crore then subtract this amount here too..8 Now add up all these figures under each head - operating , investment & financing activities -to get final figures under each head separately ; finally sum up all three heads together t o get total indirect c ash f lo w s u m m ar y fo r th e p eriod given above ..9 Finally compare your results against industry benchmarks / peer group data available online/offline sources etc.,to gauge performance vis--vis competitors /industry standards etc.,  10 You may need professional assistance while preparing Indirect CFS due its complex nature involving several calculations based on accountancy principles specific only certain countries like India where GAAP applies mandatorily.
